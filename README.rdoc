= Md5Wrapper

Md5Wrapper wraps the command line utilities md5sum (Linux) and md5 (Mac).
Detecting which utility should be used is based on the RUBY_PLATFORM constant.
It allows obtaining the md5 hexdigest of a file and checking that a file has a specific md5 hexdigest.
It does not aim to provide all features offered by the md5(sum) utilities, but anyone who needs more features is welcome to add them.

Md5Wrapper can be used as RubyGem or as Rails plugin.

== Installation as Rails plugin

From the Rails project root, execute:
  script/plugin install git://github.com/Narnach/md5_wrapper.git

== Installation as gem

Install the gem by executing:
  sudo gem install Narnach-md5_wrapper --remote --source http://gems.github.com

== Example

Get the md5 hexdigest for a file.
  Md5Wrapper.get_md5sum('foo.txt') #=> 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd'

Check the correct md5 hexdigest against a file.
  Md5Wrapper.check_md5sum('foo.txt', 'abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd') #=> true
  
Check an incorrect md5 hexdigest against a file.
  Md5Wrapper.check_md5sum('foo.txt', 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa') #=> false
